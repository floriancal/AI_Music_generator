# AI_Music_generaor

Instead of generating songs directly in the time domain this AI music generator uses a more guided approach for the AI.

The base concept is the following :
The base data are FLP projects (FL studio software from Image-Line). After a pre-process done with a C# app the data are extrected from the FLP project.
Then a Python script transforms the data into a training database for the AI. 
The data types for the AI is the following :
  - midi files with a fixed number of channels for each song, they are always a sequence of midi files for each song like Intro Couplet Refrain etc..
  - 

This repository is more a collection of code than a proper project. It is not usable in its actual state. it is badly commented (some comments are in french) and not clean code.

However this can be used as a base for a similar project.
For anyone that would like some support at using some of the features please contact me.
